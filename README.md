## Instructions

Click [Here to Play](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DamionRWilson/ConcentrationClone/blob/master/index.html)

This is a clone of the memory game Concentration. The goal is to match each card with its pair. There are a total of 16 cards and 8 pairs. Clicking a card will flip it. Remember its symbol and location, then click cards until you can find its match. The game ends when all matches are found.

In the score panel you can view the number of moves you made, your star rating (based on moves made), and how long you've been playing the round.
